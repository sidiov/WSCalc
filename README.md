The goal of this calculator was to help determine if a specific stat was better for a WS. It's all manual entry, as maintaining a list of gear and augments would likely be time consuming and quickly out of date.
    
    
    
    -It's only Windows, and only .exe (seems to work fine under Wine.)
    -You can sandbox it, requires no network
    --Maybe I will make an Android port, but its mostly for myself at my PC.
    --I built an asp.net demo, but wow hosting prices for asp.net servers are not cheap.
