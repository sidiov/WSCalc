FFXI Weaponskill Damage Calculator

The goal of this calculator was to help determine if a specific stat was better for a WS. It's all manual entry, as maintaining a list of gear and augments would likely be time consuming and quickly out of date.

    v1.2.5 - Fixed H2H WS not set to replicate fTP
    v1.2.3 - Added Dimidiation
    v1.2.2 - Added Flourishes, Crit Atk Bonus Trait, SA DEX bonus (no gear bonus)
    v1.1.5 - Added info.
    v1.1.4 - fixed Jishnu's crit not applying.
    v1.1.3 - fixed Camlann's bonus.
    
    
    -It's only Windows, and only .exe (seems to work fine under Wine.)
    --Maybe I will make an Android port, but its mostly for myself at my PC.
