FFXI Weaponskill Damage Calculator

The goal of this calculator was to help determine if a specific stat was better for a WS. It's all manual entry, as maintaining a list of gear and augments would likely be time consuming and quickly out of date.

    v1.2.3 - Added Dimidiation
    v1.2.2 - Added Flourishes, Crit Atk Bonus Trait, SA DEX bonus (no gear bonus)
    v1.1.5 - Added info.
    v1.1.4 - fixed Jishnu's crit not applying.
    v1.1.3 - fixed Camlann's bonus.

    --------Current Issues---------
    -Skill is currently estimated at around 242+cap, depending on weapon type.
    -Distance Correction / True Shot not applied to ranged WS.
    -Some boosts not checked for validity (ie. Shining One on any WS)
    -WS 'Acc varies by TP' not implemented since I couldnt find good #s.
    -Mob stats may not be valid, many have not been recorded.
    -It's only Windows, and only .exe (seems to work fine under Wine.)
    --Maybe I will make an Android port, but its mostly for myself at my PC.
